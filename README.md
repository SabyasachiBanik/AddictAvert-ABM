# AddictAvert-ABM
An Agent-based Modelling Approach to Evaluate the Effects of Different Interventions on Reducing Game Addiction.

# Overview
This repository contains all the codes for different parts of our project combined with a very nice explanation for each part. This project aims to simulate the dynamics of gaming addiction within a population having varying levels of gaming addiction and assess the effectiveness of various intervention strategies. 
For the best experience, we recommend users clone or download the entire repository. We highly encourage collaboration, feedback, and any further advancements built upon our foundational work.
